# Current

Actively building my expertise in distributed systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and observability, experimenting with:

- Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Go for high-concurrency backend services
- AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda) for scalable infrastructure
- Event-driven systems using RabbitMQ and Kafka
- gRPC and GraphQL for service communication
- Elasticsearch for search and analytics workloads
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Test-driven development across feature and unit levels
- Observability using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and New Relic for metrics, tracing, and production monitoring
